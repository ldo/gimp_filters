These are some very simple plugins for GIMP that I wrote many years
ago. I recently reworked them to use as examples of my
`pylibgimp` wrapper for the GIMP API ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/pylibgimp2),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/pylibgimp2)), so you will need that
installed to run them.

These are some very simple plugins for GIMP that I wrote many years
ago. I recently reworked them to use as examples of my
`pylibgimp` wrapper for the GIMP API ([`GitLab`](https://gitlab.com/ldo/pylibgimp2),
[`GitHub`](https://github.com/ldo/pylibgimp2)), so you will need that
installed to run them.
